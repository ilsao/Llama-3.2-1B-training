# Research Decision Log

- 2026-10-08 Asia/Taipei: User authorized autoresearch heartbeat and execution of
  the plan. Adopt 20-minute cron-driven Codex cycles with persistent state and
  overlap prevention. Restore full download/filter pipeline because storage expanded;
  retain full eval raw/tokens and implement project-only cleanup after verification.

- Runtime validation 511939 completed: 1/7-worker equivalence, native ordering,
  shuffle, split disjointness, selection, packing/masks, worker failure cursor and
  independent eval original archive/resume passed. Reconciled cost: 55 seconds,
  one H200 = 0.0152778 H200-hours. Added a separate synthetic offline-retirement
  reload scenario; this requires a new validation allocation.
